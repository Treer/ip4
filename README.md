ip4
===

A Windows command line utility which provides a compact list of the IP address of each network adapter, as well as the external IP address if the Internet is accessible.


ip4 is based off code from the [outerIP.exe utility](http://primocode.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/i-spent-couple-of-hours-searching-for.html), written by primoz@licen.net
outerIP provides more functions for external IP addresses, such as being able to launch a program when your external IP address changes.
